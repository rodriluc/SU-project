Today's goals:
  1. Troubleshoot why confusion matrix is giving me 0s for 2 of my labels
  2. Predictor for PSSM
  3. Get all scores and plots

I finished the predictor for my PSSM and my output file looks good. I am now going to focus on my scores and plots. I wrote a code to get the confusion plot as I have managed to get all the scores for all 3 models (SCV, RF, DT) and confusion matrix. I plotted my best one which was the Decision Tree.

Today's goal:
  -fix sliding window (instead of should have 3)
  -finish and complete SVM input
  
Tips and tricks:
  -Shift+Tab unindents!
  
I managed to fix my window, now outputs correct amount of windows, this was because I had an indentation error as to where I was appening my master list and I also needed to create my temporary list outside my second for loop.

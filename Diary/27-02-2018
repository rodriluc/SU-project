Today's goal:
  -fix sliding window (instead of should have 3)
  -finish and complete SVM input
  
Tips and tricks:
  -Shift+Tab unindents!
  
I managed to fix my window, now outputs correct amount of windows, this was because I had an indentation error as to where I was appending my master list and I also needed to create my temporary list outside my second for loop. 

I found a new error with the way I had coded my dictionary for the features, but managed to fix it and now outputs the correct amount of features for the correct amo8unt of windows. 

I managed to finish my predictor for Friday by converting my lists to arrays and then using SVM and fitting both.

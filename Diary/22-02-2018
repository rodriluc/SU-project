Today's goal:
  1. Input vector for sklearn
        -one-hot encoding
        -binary input

For machine learning algorithms, all input and output variables are required to be numeric. In order to convert my data to numerical data I will have to do interger encoding and then one-hot encoding. 

- I need to check whether the input integer is odd and >= than 3, for window size. 
- With a window size = input, break down the protein sequence with sliding window maybe overlap. 
- Then map protein into assigned numerical values. 
- Do the same for the features: alpha, beta, and coils.

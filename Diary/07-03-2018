Today's goal:
  1. Make predictor work
  2. Output: ID/AA sequence/predicted topology (ch not int)
  3. Append correct topology to zipped list
  
My predictor works, but I get all the predicted topologies for all the proteins in one line, I need to separate them so I can organize them. 

I made a for loop with an embedded for loop to try and call the topology prediction for each protein one at a time, but my output is incorrect. I have managed to make a list where I zip the ID, sequence and for the moment wrong topology. The topology returned is just a single predicted topology instead of the entirety of the topology for that protein. 

FINALLY, my predictor works beautifully but I need to join the topology strings together so it looks better.

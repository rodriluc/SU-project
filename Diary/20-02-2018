Today's goal:
  1. Parse file using dictionary and list function (possibility of using Panda)
        -dictionary (key=ID, [value=aa_seq,topology])
  2. Comprehend the steps that I will take in order to do the project

I made 3 separate lists: ID, amino acid sequence, and topology. Then I assigned the ID as the key, 
and zipped two different dictionaries with the amino acid sequence and topology as values. Then compared 
the keys and if they matched then set a new dictionary with the 2 values.

I need to make sure that when doing formatting the input for SVM, that teh sequences are teh same length since SVM requires it.
  - format sliding window by adding 0s or X as padding
  - input vector is 2D matrix (sample*features)
  - input has to be 2D

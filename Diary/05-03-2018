Today's goal:
  1. Save the model, so I can test it on any sequence 
  2. Run on multiple window sizes at a time to see which is best
  3. Try and return predicted topology for each individually called protein
  
I created another dictionary to return my predicted topology back into characters. Then I saved the trained model in 'trained_model' and created a new code to predict called 'predictor'.

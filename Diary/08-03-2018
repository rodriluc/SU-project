Today's goal:
  1. Save results into a file
  2. Try PSSM

I manage to save/write my results in a text file named "prediction.txt" with the following output:
  ID
  ammino acid sequence
  predicted topology

I will attempt to save each of my proteins as individual fasta file and then create a bash script where I will run a code that outputs me the PSSMs for all of them.

I managed to save each of my proteins as individual FASTA files with "file_indFASTA.py", now I will write a bash script for PSSM.

To be learnt:
from sklearn import metrics (last slide)

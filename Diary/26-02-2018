Today's goals:
  -fix problems from yesterday (AA sequence to binary and topology to numerical)
  
I fixed the problem and made sure my dictionaries gave me integer values for my one-hot encoder.
I understand that each training set must be one-dimensional and that for each window you should have 60 values, and that each window should be one after the other (separate list for each protein) for the training set.

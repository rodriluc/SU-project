Today's goals:
  -fix problems from yesterday (AA sequence to binary and topology to numerical)
  
I fixed the problem and made sure my dictionaries gave me integer values for my one-hot encoder.
I understand that each training set must be one-dimensional and that for each window you should have 60 values, and that each window should be one after the other (separate list for each protein) for the training set.

Problem to be fixed:
  -do not have the same number of features and windows
Solution: 
  -just used my topology list, and ignored windows (solved!)

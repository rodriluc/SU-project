Today's goals:
  -fix problems from yesterday (AA sequence to binary and topology to numerical)
  
I fixed the problem and made sure my dictionaries gave me integer values for my one-hot encoder.
I understand that each training set must be one-dimensional and that for each window you should have 60 values, and that each window should be one after the other (separate list for each protein) for the training set.

Problem 1 to be fixed:
  -do not have the same number of features and windows
Solution: 
  -just used my topology list, and ignored windows (solved!)

Problem 2 to be fixed:
  -padding does not work
  -do I need sublist
Solution: 
  -added an embedded "if" statement
  
Problem 3 to be fixed:
  -my final_AAlist outputs 27 windows when I specify a window length of 3
  -I want to concatenate every 3 window as one long list and appended them to a master list (so for this example, I want 9 lists)
Solution:
  - to be determined
  
For tomorrow:
  -figure out how to extend list and SVM input

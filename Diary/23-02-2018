Today I pushed my repository with my work for the week, and tried to figure out how to do the sliding window and convert my input into binary numbers. The main focus of today was trying to figure to figure out how to include account for all the residues with the sliding window. Currently, I don't take into account the first or last residues therefore I am going to add 'X' for those residues so the window has a holder when looking at the last amino acid (AA sequence - 1).
